How to use this program: 
1. Download this file by clicking on the green button to the right of this page and selecting Download ZIP
2. Extract the file after it is downloaded
3. After the zip file is extracted, go into the folder called Dist
4. There is a file called either main or main.exe. Double click on it to start the program
5. A window should pop up. The first tab will have the URL, Artist, etc entries. The URL is required, and the rest are 
   optional but encouraged. 
6. The second tab is where track information will be placed. There is a help button on the tab you can click on to see
   how everything should be formatted. 
7. Press Ok when you are done, and *be patient*. I'm still figuring out the progress bars, and the conversions take awhile. 
   Give it about 5 minutes. 
8. Done. The program will automatically generate a folder formatted as 'Artist - Album (year)'. This folder will contain
   all the mp3 files. Enjoy!
   
Known Issues/Future Additions:
1. Song names with odd characters (for example: Japanese symbols) may not be accepted by the program. Additionally, I think 
   song names with double quotes might cause an issue. To be save, remove all odd characters in the track listing. 
2. I'm still trying to figure out progress bars (particularly with ffmpeg converting from .webm to .mp3)
3. I'd like to allow uploading the album artwork as well. I need to check on how the metadata tagger labels artwork, since
   I'm sure they have that feature.
